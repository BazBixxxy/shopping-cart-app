This is my shopping cart project and inside it I have used a bunch of really world technologies to keep it up to date.

It took me close to 100 hours to figure out, but I prevailed and completed it.


Some of the technologies used include:
- react
- vanilla js
- json
- react-router
- context api
- react icons
- react media
